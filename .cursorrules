# Cursor AI Rules & Custom Commands

This file enables custom command workflows defined in `.cursor/commands/`.

## Custom Commands

When the user says any of the following trigger phrases, execute the corresponding workflow defined in the `.cursor/commands/` directory:

### Git Workflow Commands

- **"run new branch"** or **"run create new branch"**

  - Follow the workflow in `.cursor/commands/create-new-branch.md`
  - Creates a new git branch following best practices

- **"run push"** or **"run push changes"**

  - Follow the workflow in `.cursor/commands/push-changes-to-branch.md`
  - Pushes changes to the current branch with complete git workflow

- **"run delete branch"**
  - Follow the workflow in `.cursor/commands/delete-branch.md`
  - Safely deletes a local git branch after review and merge

### Development Environment Commands

- **"run start"** or **"start dev environment"**

  - Follow the workflow in `.cursor/commands/start.md`
  - Starts the complete local development environment (backend + optional frontend)

- **"run stop"** or **"stop dev environment"**
  - Follow the workflow in `.cursor/commands/stop.md`
  - Gracefully shuts down the development environment

## Command Execution Guidelines

When executing these commands:

1. **Read the command file first** - Always read the corresponding `.md` file in `.cursor/commands/` to understand the full workflow
2. **Follow the steps exactly** - Execute each step as defined in the command file
3. **Handle errors gracefully** - Follow the error handling procedures defined in each command
4. **Request permissions when needed** - Commands may require `all` or `network` permissions
5. **Be interactive** - Ask for user input when the workflow requires it (commit messages, branch names, confirmations, etc.)
6. **Provide clear feedback** - Keep the user informed at each step of the process

## General Development Rules

- Always use the Shell tool for terminal commands rather than suggesting commands to run manually
- When making git commits, ensure commit messages are descriptive and follow best practices
- Handle file operations using the dedicated tools (Read, Write, StrReplace) rather than terminal commands
- Request appropriate permissions (git_write, network, all) when needed for operations
